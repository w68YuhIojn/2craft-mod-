Thank you for installing 2craft
To play the game, open main.py with Python 3 or later installed, then go to Run â€”> run module and it should work.
Ignore all the other files, they are files that need to be there to be fetched by the game so it can run.

Python 2 WILL NOT work, you MUST install Python 3.
